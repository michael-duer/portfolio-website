        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <div className="about-me-text">
            <p>I'm a student from Bern currently at my bachelors degree studying social science and computer science</p>
            <p>My programming journey started when I was 13 years old with a book called "Spielend C++ lernen". First it was only occasionally but my passion especially for web development really took off in university. Since then I try to learn new things mostly related to web development or R programming</p>
